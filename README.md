# CPP
first open the FINAL450 sheet
you will see alphabets assigned to each topic
to find the question and solution for each question in that topic open respective c++ file
ex., for dynamic programming go to N_{x}.cpp , here x vary depending on number of questions in sheet.
for some topics there are multiple files like N_1.cpp , N_2.cpp etc , which means those files may or may not contain extra questions for the same topic
most of the problem from the sheet is covered in brute force to most optimle solution with time and space complexity.
